<p>These outfits are great if you are travelling to a city where the weather may be snowy cold rainy or generally miserable. For cold weather trips in urban areas Ill usually pack a pair of pants or leggings and a mid-length skirt and warm wool-lined tights. Spice up your casual winter outfits with some cute accessories to accentuate your look. Unlike summer travel where youre packing a ton of separates like bathing suits shorts pants and short-sleeve shirts winter packing is all about layering and getting creative with a limited number of cozy pieces.
